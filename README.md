<h2>An obstacle-aware path planning strategy in disconnected WSNs with
multiple mobile sinks</h2>

It developed using C# and WPF in .NET 4.5. 

This toolkit is a simulation for Multiple Mobile Sinks (MMSs) scenarios in WSN-based IoT.

A view of the simulator is given in the figures below:

To install, you need to download [initialtoolkit](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~anmande/miniflow/toolkit.rar), then just run MMSs.exe after downloading all the shared files.

Noted that the current simulator is developed mode [main_simulator](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~anmande/miniflow/).

<h4>How to use the toolkit of simple testing:</h4>

1- Open MMSs.exe.

2- Import the required network topology, from File-> Import Topology.

3- Set the mobile sink mean speed from the main menu Mobile Sink-> Set Mean Sink Speed, and set the desired speed.

4- From the main menu, select Coverage->Random

5- To select the rate of sending packet, from the main menu Test-> Select one Source per time, and select the desired rate.


<h4>How to use the toolkit for experiments and evaluation</h4>

1- Open MMSs.exe.

2- Import the required network topology, from File-> Import Topology.

3- Set the experiment settings, after clicking Experiment, and click Start.

4- After the scenario is run, results are obtained from Show Results ->

<h3>Instance: using drones in the construction industry</h4>

Construction is one industry that’s really taken drones and run with them. Drone use in construction is up year-on-year, and that looks et to continue. There are two simple reasons why drones are so popular in construction – they can save developers time and money. Builders love drones because they can provide an aerial view of either sites or potential sites with simple and affordable ease.

Previously, you had to pay for a manned aircraft to get such an aerial view. The cost of doing that can be prohibitive to many building firms, especially smaller ones. Even those that could afford to do it, wouldn’t do it regularly.

Now with drones, you can get up-to-date images as often as you like. Every day if you need them. That means you can get a real feel for how the build is progressing. Drones allow builders the chance to develop better plans, track progress and monitor any issues with the construction by providing an unrivalled wide-view of a site at a fraction of the cost.

<h3>Instance: Tracking of AGVs </h4>

Controlling all AGVs through a wireless communication system, where the vehicle will be able to communicate via wireless static control central mode as each vehicle is employed as a node so that the data is processed more efficiently.
