<h3>An Intelligent Tour Planning for Disconnected Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with Multiple Mobile Sinks</h3>

This toolkit is a simulation for Multiple Mobile Sinks (MMSs) scenarios in WSN-based IoT. It developed using C# and WPF in .NET 4.5.

To install, you need to download [initialtoolkit](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~anmande/miniflow/toolkit.rar), then just run MMSs.exe after downloading all the shared files.

Noted that the current simulator is developed mode [main_simulator](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~anmande/miniflow/), for which we also thank and cite them.

<h4>How to use the toolkit of simple testing:</h4>

1- Open MMSs.exe.

2- Import the required network topology, from File-> Import Topology.

3- Set the mobile sink mean speed from the main menu Mobile Sink-> Set Mean Sink Speed, and set the desired speed.

4- From the main menu, select Coverage->Random

5- To select the rate of sending packet, from the main menu Test-> Select one Source per time, and select the desired rate.


<h4>How to use the toolkit for experiments and evaluation</h4>

1- Open MMSs.exe.

2- Import the required network topology, from File-> Import Topology.

3- Set the experiment settings, after clicking Experiment, and click Start.
