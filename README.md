# INTERLINK
<h3>An Intelligent Tour Planning for Disconnected Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with Multiple Mobile Sinks</h3>
It developed using C# and WPF in .NET 4.5. 

This toolkit is a simulation for Multiple Mobile Sinks (MMSs) scenarios in WSN-based IoT where the system properties on which the simulator was executed are as follows: Operating system: Windows 10 Enterprise-64bit, Memory: 8 GB RAM, and CPU: Intel Core i7.

To install, you need to download [initialtoolkit](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~anmande/miniflow/toolkit.rar), then just run MMSs.exe after downloading all the shared files.

Noted that the current simulator is developed mode [main_simulator](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~anmande/miniflow/).

<h4>How to use the toolkit of simple testing:</h4>

1- Open MMSs.exe.

2- Import the required network topology, from File-> Import Topology.

3- Set the mobile sink mean speed from the main menu Mobile Sink-> Set Mean Sink Speed, and set the desired speed.

4- From the main menu, select Coverage->Random

5- To select the rate of sending packet, from the main menu Test-> Select one Source per time, and select the desired rate.


<h4>How to use the toolkit for experiments and evaluation</h4>

1- Open MMSs.exe.

2- Import the required network topology, from File-> Import Topology.

3- Set the experiment settings, after clicking Experiment, and click Start.

4- After the scenario is run, results are obtained from Show Results ->

<h3> Main Problem (Numerical Example)</h3>

![problem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10537549/201293082-8b5c8c7d-18ee-4b00-b188-c8a4991fde48.png)

Assume that the maximum throughput from MSs to the BS is $T_{max}$ bit/sec and the data volume generated by each node is $B_k$ bytes, hence our problem definition is how all data (especially high-priority data) should be gathered and retrieved to the BS during the total traveling time $T$ s by MSs?. 

A numerical instance is depicted in above example figure, where node A has high-priority data and needs to deliver its data to the MS as soon as possible. Assume that $B_k$ is 2000 bytes, the latency of one-hop is 1s, and $T_{max}$ of each MS is 4000 bit/s. As shown in above figure, for traditional algorithms, the nodes only transmit the measured data to the nearest MS, and then the MS delivers them to the BS, whose transmission time of isolated network C is 32 s, such that (5×2000×8/4000) for inform node 1 and (3×2000×8/4000) for inform node 2. 
Above figure depicts another instance of opportunistic data collection. Node A firstly transmits its data to node B by the established shortcut link, and then those data are gathered by the inform node 2. Note that the inform nodes are determined based on the constructed grids where further details of how to form grids and choose inform nodes will be explained in the following. In this case, the times are 16 s (4×2000×8/4000) for inform node 1 and 13 s (1+3×2000×8/4000) for inform node 2. 

Apparently, <h4>our method (INTERLINK)</h4> spends less time about 3 sec than the traditional method.
