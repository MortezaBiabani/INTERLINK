# INTERLINK
<h2>An Intelligent Tour Planning for Disconnected Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with Multiple Mobile Sinks</h2>

It developed using C# and WPF in .NET 4.5. 

This toolkit is a simulation for Multiple Mobile Sinks (MMSs) scenarios in WSN-based IoT where the system properties on which the simulator was executed are as follows: Operating system: Windows 10 Enterprise-64bit, Memory: 8 GB RAM, and CPU: Intel Core i7. 

A view of the simulator is given in the figure below:

To install, you need to download [initialtoolkit](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~anmande/miniflow/toolkit.rar), then just run MMSs.exe after downloading all the shared files.

Noted that the current simulator is developed mode [main_simulator](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~anmande/miniflow/). 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h4>How to use the toolkit of simple testing:</h4>

1- Open MMSs.exe.

2- Import the required network topology, from File-> Import Topology.

3- Set the mobile sink mean speed from the main menu Mobile Sink-> Set Mean Sink Speed, and set the desired speed.

4- From the main menu, select Coverage->Random

5- To select the rate of sending packet, from the main menu Test-> Select one Source per time, and select the desired rate.


<h4>How to use the toolkit for experiments and evaluation</h4>

1- Open MMSs.exe.

2- Import the required network topology, from File-> Import Topology.

3- Set the experiment settings, after clicking Experiment, and click Start.

4- After the scenario is run, results are obtained from Show Results ->

<h3> Main Problem (Numerical Example)</h3>


  ![problem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10537549/201293082-8b5c8c7d-18ee-4b00-b188-c8a4991fde48.png)


<h4>Q: Assume that the maximum throughput from MSs to the BS is $T_{max}$ bit/sec and the data volume generated by each node is $B_k$ bytes, hence our problem definition is how all data (especially high-priority data) should be gathered and retrieved to the BS during the total traveling time $T$ s by MSs?.</h4>

A numerical instance is depicted in above example figure, where node A has high-priority data and needs to deliver its data to the MS as soon as possible. Assume that $B_k$ is 2000 bytes, the latency of one-hop is 1s, and $T_{max}$ of each MS is 4000 bit/s. 

As shown in above figure, for traditional algorithms, the nodes only transmit the measured data to the nearest MS, and then the MS delivers them to the BS, whose transmission time of isolated network C is 32 s, such that **(5×2000×8/4000)** for RP 1 and **(3×2000×8/4000)** for RP 2. 

Above figure depicts another instance of opportunistic data collection. Node A firstly transmits its data to node B by the established shortcut link, and then those data are gathered by RP 2. In this case, the times are 16 s **(4×2000×8/4000)** for RP 1 and 13 s **(1+3×2000×8/4000)** for RP 2. 

Apparently, **our method (INTERLINK)** spends less time about 3 sec than the traditional method.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h4>Our main idea</h4> 

is to use **Small-World Network** and **Virtual square grid-based coverage algorithm** so that the shortcut links mentioned in the above example are generated.

<h3>Instance: using drones in the construction industry</h4>

People have been building things for a long time – that’s for sure. Construction has been around for centuries, and it should be round for many more. However, construction today isn’t the same as it was a thousand years ago. As with anything, things modernise and develop. Today, things are moving faster than ever, and new ideas, methods and technologies are entering the construction industry every year.

That’s why drones have started to make such a big impact. While they aren’t helping the actual labour process (yet) – they’ve still got a huge role to play in the construction industry, and that role is growing. Drones have helped revolutionalize the planning stages of construction, along with land surveying and data capturing. And these are just a few of the uses for drones in construction.

Construction is one industry that’s really taken drones and run with them. Drone use in construction is up year-on-year, and that looks et to continue. There are two simple reasons why drones are so popular in construction – they can save developers time and money. Builders love drones because they can provide an aerial view of either sites or potential sites with simple and affordable ease.

Previously, you had to pay for a manned aircraft to get such an aerial view. The cost of doing that can be prohibitive to many building firms, especially smaller ones. Even those that could afford to do it, wouldn’t do it regularly.

Now with drones, you can get up-to-date images as often as you like. Every day if you need them. That means you can get a real feel for how the build is progressing. Drones allow builders the chance to develop better plans, track progress and monitor any issues with the construction by providing an unrivalled wide-view of a site at a fraction of the cost.
